  {

    answer:
      "NNN lease properties offer stable passive income through credit-rated corporate tenants who assume all property expenses, maintenance, and risks. These recession-proof businesses provide guaranteed monthly cash flow with zero management responsibilities for property owners.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of businesses typically use triple net leases?",
    answer:
      "Essential service businesses dominate NNN leases including fast-food restaurants (Taco Bell, Wendy's), drug stores (Walgreens, CVS), convenience stores (7-Eleven), medical clinics, auto parts stores (AutoZone), dollar stores (Dollar General), car washes, and gas station-convenience store combinations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the different types of triple net leases?",
    answer:
      "Absolute NNN leases have tenants paying all expenses including taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Regular NNN leases are similar but may require landlords to cover some costs like roof repairs. Ground leases involve land-only rentals lasting 20-99 years where tenants pay all development costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I evaluate tenant creditworthiness for NNN properties?",
    answer:
      "Review S&P and Moody's credit ratings, financial statements, business stability during economic downturns, and lease guarantees. Investment-grade rated tenants provide the highest security for passive income investments.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of owning NNN lease properties?",
    answer:
      "NNN properties offer low entry barriers ($500K-$2M+), predictable monthly income with rent escalations, zero management responsibilities, tax advantages, and security not found in traditional investments. Corporate tenants assume all property risks.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does passive income work with triple net lease properties?",
    answer:
      "Property owners collect guaranteed monthly rent payments while tenants handle all property expenses, maintenance, and management. This creates truly passive income streams with corporate-level reliability and long-term lease guarantees (10-20+ years).",
  },
